# Release Notes - v0.1.2-alpha

**Release Date:** October 4, 2025  
**Tag:** `v0.1.2-alpha`

## Summary

This release focuses on improving the installation experience and documentation. The major enhancement is a **one-click installer** that automates certificate installation and MSIX setup, eliminating the manual steps that previously confused users. We've also completely reorganized the documentation for better discoverability and maintainability.

## New Features

### One-Click Installer
- **Install-Differ.bat** - Double-click batch file that handles everything automatically
- **install-certificate.ps1** - PowerShell script for certificate installation with proper error handling
- **Automated certificate import** - Installs to both Trusted Root and Trusted People stores (fixes error 0x800B0100)
- **Complete installer package** - All necessary files bundled in release artifacts

### Documentation Improvements
- **Consolidated documentation structure** - Clear separation of concerns across `distribution/`, `engineering/`, `overview/`, `user-guide/`, and `branding/` folders
- **Central documentation hub** - `docs/index.md` provides clear navigation paths for different user needs
- **Historical archive** - Old sprint notes and release documents moved to `docs/history/` for better organization
