## Next Step: Create ICO File

You need to convert the PNG files to a multi-resolution ICO file. Here are your options:

### Option 1: Online Converter (Easiest - 2 minutes)

1. Go to: **https://convertio.co/png-ico/**
2. Upload all 4 PNG files from `icon-output/`
3. Click "Convert"
4. Download the result as `differ.ico`
5. Save it to: `src/Differ.App/Resources/differ.ico`

### Option 2: Icons8 Download (Best Quality - 5 minutes)

1. Go to: **https://icons8.com/icons/set/compare**
2. Search for "compare files" or "diff"
3. Find an icon you like
4. Download as ICO format (256x256 with multiple sizes)
5. Rename to `differ.ico`
6. Save to: `src/Differ.App/Resources/differ.ico`

### Option 3: Use Windows Paint + Converter (DIY - 10 minutes)

1. Open `icon-output/differ-256.png` in Paint
2. Add a large "D" letter in white
3. Save as new PNG
4. Use online converter to create ICO
5. Save to: `src/Differ.App/Resources/differ.ico`

### Option 4: GIMP (Professional - 15 minutes)

If you have GIMP installed:
1. Open GIMP
2. File → Open → Select `differ-256.png`
3. Add text layer with "D"
4. Flatten image
5. File → Export As
6. Choose `.ico` format
7. Select sizes: 16, 32, 48, 256
8. Export to: `src/Differ.App/Resources/differ.ico`

## What Happens Next

Once you have `differ.ico` in the Resources folder:

1. I'll update `Differ.App.csproj` to include it
2. I'll update the XAML windows to display it
3. We'll rebuild and test
4. Icon will appear in title bars, taskbar, etc.

## Temporary Solution

If you want to skip the icon for now and continue with Sprint 2:
- The project will build without the icon
- You can add it later
- Everything else in Sprint 2 can proceed

## File Requirements

### For ICO file:
- Name: `differ.ico`
- Location: `src/Differ.App/Resources/`
- Sizes included: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 256x256
- Format: Windows Icon (.ico)
- Max size: < 100KB

### Quick Check
To verify your ICO file is good:
- Right-click the .ico file
- Check file size (should be 50-100KB)
- Open in Windows Photo Viewer - it should show multiple sizes

## Ready to Continue?

Let me know when you've:
- [ ] Created/downloaded `differ.ico`
- [ ] Placed it in `src/Differ.App/Resources/`
- [ ] Ready for me to integrate it into the project

Or tell me to:
- [ ] Continue without icon (we'll add it later)
- [ ] Skip Sprint 2 and move to Sprint 3

Current blue square images work as a backup, but a proper ICO with the "D" letter or a comparison symbol would be much better!
