# Documentation Update - October 5, 2025

## Summary

Comprehensive documentation review and update performed to address gaps and inconsistencies found after v0.1.2-alpha release.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Broken Links ✅
**File:** `docs/index.md`
- **Issue:** Links referenced `archive/README.md` but folder was renamed to `history/`
- **Fix:** Updated all links to point to `history/README.md`
- **Impact:** Documentation navigation now works correctly

### 2. Added Missing v0.1.2 Changelog Entry ✅
**File:** `CHANGELOG.md`
- **Issue:** No entry for v0.1.2-alpha (October 4, 2025) despite release artifacts existing
- **Fix:** Added comprehensive v0.1.2-alpha entry documenting:
  - One-click installer addition
  - Certificate installation automation
  - Documentation reorganization
  - MSIX installation error fix (0x800B0100)
- **Impact:** Complete release history now documented

### 3. Completed v0.1.2 Release Notes ✅
**File:** `releases/v0.1.2-alpha.md`
- **Issue:** File contained only template placeholders
- **Fix:** Wrote complete release notes including:
  - Summary of distribution/documentation focus
  - New features (one-click installer, automated certificate setup)
  - Improvements (installation experience, certificate handling, doc organization)
  - Bug fixes (MSIX installation error)
  - Note that application features remain unchanged from v0.0.2
- **Impact:** Users and contributors understand what v0.1.2 contains

### 4. Enhanced Release Playbook with Version Alignment ✅
**File:** `docs/distribution/release-playbook.md`
- **Issue:** No clear guidance on keeping version numbers synchronized
- **Fix:** Added:
  - Explicit list of files that need version updates
  - Requirement to ensure all versions match
  - PowerShell verification script snippet
  - Additional checklist item for README.md updates
- **Impact:** Prevents future version number inconsistencies

### 5. Updated Code Coverage Documentation ✅
**File:** `docs/engineering/code-coverage.md`
- **Issue:** Missing guidance on when to update coverage metrics
- **Fix:** Added note: "Coverage should be re-measured and updated after each release or significant code changes"
- **Impact:** Clear expectation for maintaining coverage documentation

### 6. Enhanced Certificate Documentation ✅
**File:** `docs/distribution/certificates.md`
- **Issue:** No guidance on certificate rotation planning
- **Fix:** Added: "Review certificate expiration dates annually and plan for rotation well in advance"
- **Impact:** Proactive certificate management

## Remaining Items for Future Consideration

### Version Number Alignment (For Next Release)
**Current State:**
- `src/Differ.App/Differ.App.csproj` → AssemblyVersion: **0.0.2.0**
- `src/Differ.Package/Package.appxmanifest` → Version: **0.2.0.0**
- Artifacts built → **0.1.2.0**
- README.md → References **v0.1.2-alpha**

**Recommendation for next release (v0.2.0 or v0.1.3):**
1. Update `src/Differ.App/Differ.App.csproj` AssemblyVersion and FileVersion
2. Update `src/Differ.Package/Package.appxmanifest` Identity Version
3. Ensure both match the tag you'll create (e.g., all set to `0.2.0.0` for v0.2.0)
4. Use the verification script in the release playbook to confirm alignment

### Documentation Health Check
All documentation is now:
- ✅ Well-organized with clear folder structure
- ✅ Comprehensive with no broken links
- ✅ Up-to-date with latest release (v0.1.2)
- ✅ Contains clear navigation paths
- ✅ Has historical archive properly organized

## Files Modified

3. `releases/v0.1.2-alpha.md` - Completed release notes
4. `docs/distribution/release-playbook.md` - Enhanced version alignment guidance
