# Documentation Archive

This folder keeps historical notes, sprint recaps, and release summaries that no longer belong in the core docs but remain valuable for context.

## Sprint notes

Legacy sprint documents have been moved here without modification:

- `sprints/SPRINT1_BRANDING_COMPLETE.md`
- `sprints/SPRINT1_QUICK_TEST.md`
- `sprints/SPRINT1_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md`
- `sprints/SPRINT1_VISUAL_SUMMARY.md`
- `sprints/SPRINT2_PLAN.md`
- `sprints/SPRINT2_COMPLETE.md`
- `sprints/SPRINT3_PLAN.md`
- `sprints/SPRINT3_COMPLETE.md`
- `sprints/SPRINT4_PLAN.md`

## Release history

Original release write-ups are preserved under `releases/`:

- `releases/v0.0.2-alpha.md`
- `releases/v0.1.0-alpha.md`

Future releases should rely on the main [Release playbook](../distribution/release-playbook.md) and changelog. Use this folder for archival snapshots only.

## Additional history

Other historical notes are grouped under `notes/` by topic:

- `notes/certificates/` – certificate discovery, fix plans, and completion logs.
- `notes/installers/` – one-click installer implementation and testing records.
- `notes/icons/` – previous icon strategy and location guides.
- `notes/logging/` – logging refactor write-up.
- `notes/packaging/` – original MSIX packaging deep dive.
- `notes/quality/` – legacy QA checklist and coverage review.
- `notes/quick-start/` – archived quick-start walkthrough.

When updating documentation, prefer the consolidated guides. Add new historical summaries here only when the content is specifically for retrospectives or audit trails.
