# Icon Documentation Archive

These files capture the step-by-step history of Differ's icon work. They informed the current [branding guide](../../../../branding/icons.md) and remain here for reference.

- `STRATEGY.md` – unified source approach and data flow.
- `UNIFIED_IMPLEMENTATION.md` – implementation log for the automation.
- `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` – completion report with validation notes.
- `CREATION_GUIDE.md` – tutorial for designing icons from scratch.
- `LOCATIONS.md` – exhaustive mapping of icon files across the repo.

When updating branding, start with the consolidated guide; consult these documents only if you need historical detail or rationale.
