## Critical Discovery 🔍

### The Two-Store Requirement

MSIX packages with self-signed certificates require installation to **TWO** certificate stores:

1. **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** (`Cert:\LocalMachine\Root`)
   - For general certificate trust

2. **Trusted People** (`Cert:\LocalMachine\TrustedPeople`)  
   - **CRITICAL for MSIX installation**
   - Missing this causes error: `0x800B0100: The app package must be digitally signed`

This requirement was **not initially obvious** and caused the first installation attempt to fail. After manual testing and research, I discovered this requirement and verified it works.

## Test Results

### Installation Flow ✅
1. User downloads 4 files from GitHub release
2. User double-clicks `Install-Differ.bat`
3. UAC prompts for admin rights → user clicks "Yes"
4. PowerShell window opens with Differ banner
5. Script discovers certificate and MSIX files automatically
6. Certificate installed to both stores ✅
7. MSIX package installed successfully ✅
8. Application appears in Start Menu ✅
9. User can launch Differ immediately ✅

### Verification ✅
```powershell
PS> Get-AppxPackage | Where-Object { $_.Name -like '*Differ*' }

Name            Version InstallLocation
----            ------- ---------------
csseeker.Differ 0.2.0.0 C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\csseeker.Differ_0.2.0.0_x64__ehc6naj0x1g74
```

## Files Ready for Release

All files are in the `artifacts/` directory and ready for GitHub release:

```
artifacts/
├── Differ_0.2.0.0_x64.msix              # 71.5 MB - Signed MSIX package
├── Differ-v0.2.0-portable-win-x64.zip   # 70.3 MB - Portable alternative
├── differ-signing-cert.cer              # 776 bytes - Public certificate
├── install-differ.ps1                   # 16 KB - One-click installer
├── Install-Differ.bat                   # ~1 KB - Batch launcher
├── Install-Differ-Direct.bat            # ~1 KB - Alternative launcher
└── README.md                            # User instructions
```

## Security Measures ✅

- ✅ `.gitignore` updated to protect private key (`.pfx` files)
- ✅ Only public certificate (`.cer`) distributed
- ✅ Private key never leaves development machine
- ✅ All scripts reviewed for security best practices

## User Experience

### For Non-Technical Users 🎯
**30-second installation:**
1. Download 4 files
2. Double-click `Install-Differ.bat`
3. Click "Yes" on UAC prompt
4. Done!

### For Technical Users 🔧
- Can use PowerShell directly
- Can inspect certificates before installation
- Can verify MSIX signature
- Can use portable ZIP if preferred

### For Developers 👨‍💻
- Complete documentation of certificate infrastructure
- Scripts can be reused for future versions
- All source code available for inspection

## Lessons Learned

1. **MSIX certificate requirements are not well documented**
   - The TrustedPeople store requirement is critical but rarely mentioned
   - Error messages don't clearly indicate which store is missing

2. **File encoding matters**
   - PowerShell scripts can have encoding issues that cause parse errors
   - Always verify scripts run before distribution

3. **User experience is paramount**
   - One-click installation is worth the extra effort
   - Clear error messages and troubleshooting steps are essential
   - Fallback option (portable ZIP) is important

4. **Testing on clean systems is crucial**
   - Developer machines may have different certificate configurations
   - Always test installation flow from scratch

## Next Steps

### Immediate
- [x] Test installation successfully ✅
- [x] Update all documentation ✅
- [x] Fix script encoding issues ✅
- [ ] Commit all changes to Git
- [ ] Create GitHub release v0.2.0

### Future Improvements
