# Installer Project Archive

These documents chronicle the development of Differ's one-click MSIX installer and related testing. They are superseded by the consolidated [Installing Differ guide](../../../user-guide/installing-differ.md) but remain here for historical reference.

- `INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md` – original end-user installation guide.
- `ONE_CLICK_INSTALLER_COMPLETE.md` – implementation summary.
- `ONE_CLICK_INSTALLER_TESTING_COMPLETE.md` – validation and test notes.
- `INSTALLATION_TEST_RESULTS.md` – extended installation test logs.

Refer to them when you need the development rationale or detailed test transcripts.
