# Quality & Testing Archive

Historic QA materials retained for context. The active checklists now live in the [Release playbook](../../../distribution/release-playbook.md).

- `QA.md` – original manual testing matrix.
- `TEST_COVERAGE_REVIEW.md` – detailed coverage improvement report (Oct 2025).

Use these documents only when you need the deeper background or past metrics.
