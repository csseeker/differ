## üîß Technical Details

### Icon Configuration

#### 1. Executable Icon (Compile-Time)
```xml
<!-- Differ.App.csproj -->
<ApplicationIcon>Resources\differ.ico</ApplicationIcon>
```
- Embedded into .exe during build
- Used by Windows shell (Explorer, taskbar, etc.)
- Multi-resolution ICO file (16, 32, 48 pixels)

#### 2. Window Icon (Runtime)
```xml
<!-- MainWindow.xaml -->
<Window Icon="pack://application:,,,/Differ.App;component/Resources/icon-256.png">
```
- Displayed at runtime in window title bar
- Uses pack URI to reference embedded resource
- Higher quality PNG for better display

#### 3. Resource Embedding
```xml
<!-- Differ.App.csproj -->
<ItemGroup>
  <Resource Include="Resources\icon-256.png" />
</ItemGroup>
```
- Embeds PNG as WPF resource
- Available via pack URI at runtime

## üîÑ Easy Icon Replacement Process

When you want to replace with a custom icon:

### Quick Steps
1. Get or create 256x256 PNG icon
2. Convert to ICO: https://convertio.co/png-ico/
3. Replace `src/Differ.App/Resources/differ.ico`
4. Replace `src/Differ.App/Resources/icon-256.png`
5. Optionally replace MSIX icons in `src/Differ.Package/Images/`
6. Rebuild: `dotnet build`

## üìù Notes

### About Placeholder Icons
The current blue square icons are **fully functional placeholders**. They:
- Work perfectly for testing and development
- Can be replaced anytime without code changes
- Demonstrate proper icon integration

### Future Icon Design
When creating a custom icon, consider:
- **Concept:** Represents directory/file comparison
- **Colors:** Professional (blue, gray) or distinctive (orange, green)
- **Simplicity:** Must be clear at 16x16 pixels
- **Uniqueness:** Distinguishable from other tools

Recommended concepts:
- Split folders showing comparison
- Overlapping documents with arrows
- Letter "D" with visual split design
- Files with magnifying glass
